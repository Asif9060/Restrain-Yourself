Implement date selection validation for the calendar to restrict user access as follows:

1. Allow selection of only:
   - Current date (today)
   - Previous day (yesterday)

2. Requirements:
   - Block all future dates from being selected or marked
   - Maintain all existing calendar functionality
   - Show future dates as visually disabled/inactive
   - Display a user-friendly message when attempting to select future dates
   - Use the system's current date as reference point

3. Technical constraints:
   - Only modify date selection logic
   - Preserve existing calendar UI and features
   - Implement client-side validation
   - Handle timezone differences appropriately
   - Ensure date comparisons use consistent formats

4. Error handling:
   - Gracefully handle invalid date selections
   - Provide clear feedback when users attempt to select blocked dates

No additional features or modifications beyond date restriction should be implemented.
