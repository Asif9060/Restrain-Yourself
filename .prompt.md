Create a responsive layout optimized for mobile devices (320px-480px) and tablets (481px-768px) using modern CSS techniques. Implement the following:

1. Set appropriate viewport meta tag
2. Use mobile-first CSS media queries
3. Implement fluid typography and spacing
4. Ensure touch-friendly UI elements (minimum 44px tap targets)
5. Optimize images and media content
6. Stack columns and adjust grid layouts for smaller screens
7. Hide/show elements based on screen size where necessary
8. Maintain readable line lengths (45-75 characters)
9. Test on common mobile browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android)
10. Validate layout at key breakpoints:
    - Mobile: 320px, 375px, 480px
    - Tablet: 600px, 768px

Use modern CSS features like CSS Grid, Flexbox, and clamp() for responsive scaling. Ensure performance by minimizing layout shifts and optimizing asset loading.
