Optimize the mobile responsiveness of the layout while preserving all desktop design elements and functionality exactly as-is. Implement mobile-specific adjustments that:

1. Maintain the current desktop layout, dimensions, and responsiveness without any modifications
2. Add responsive breakpoints specifically for mobile viewports (max-width: 768px)
3. Adapt layout, spacing, and text sizing appropriately for mobile screens
4. Ensure touch-friendly interaction areas on mobile
5. Optimize images and media for mobile bandwidth/screens
6. Preserve all existing desktop functionality and behavior
7. Test mobile changes across iOS and Android devices

Document any mobile-specific CSS changes separately from desktop styles.
